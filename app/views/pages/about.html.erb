      <p class="r5-lead">
        Reasy was born from a simple observation: buying and selling property in Australia is unnecessarily expensive, stressful, and opaque. We believe there's a better way.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To democratise property transactions by providing the tools, guidance, and platform that enable buyers and sellers to connect directly. We help you save thousands in agent commissions while maintaining full control over your property journey.

      <h2>Our Values</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transparency first</strong> &mdash; No hidden agendas. We succeed when you succeed.</li>
        <li><strong>Empowerment over dependence</strong> &mdash; We give you the tools to make informed decisions, not decisions made for you.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust is earned</strong> &mdash; Every user is verified. Every review is real. Every dollar is accounted for.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple beats complex</strong> &mdash; Property transactions are already complicated enough. We make the process as simple as possible.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>
        We're a team of property enthusiasts, technologists, and legal experts. We've bought and sold property ourselves, and we've experienced the frustration of the traditional process. That's why we're building something better.
